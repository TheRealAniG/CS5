Choice 1 Reading "Is the Universe a Simulation by Edward Frenkel"

Prompt: Are we actually in a simulation? Yes? No? Maybe...? 
Why do you think so (or not)?

I don't think we are in a simulation. While I found the comparison to the Matrix 
intresting, and maybe I am taking the blue pill here, I simply cannot 
believe that we are living in a simulation. One, I think it would be so unbelievably
complicated. I don't know how someone would make that, like how do you code human
emotion? Also, I am made of flesh and bone I don't see how that can be a simulation.
Also, I am a conscious human being(I think) so I don't see how I would have
consciousness in a simulation.

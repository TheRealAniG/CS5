The introduction of these AI tools like has made the question of ownership more complicated.
A human can use a tool to create something, and it is unclear if it was created by the human or computer.
I think it was created by both, but the computer can't really own something.
So technically I believe authorship goes to the author, but not completely.
I'm not sure what the traditional copyright laws are, but I believe authorship when it comes to 
AI created art can be a modified version of traditional laws. Maybe the human author can get some rights
but not all that they would if it was entirely created by them.

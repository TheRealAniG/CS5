This article distinguishes between algorithms and authors, e.g., often, algorithms and online
results simply reflect people's attitudes and behavior. To what extent do you agree that algorithms 
are (or aren't) subjective as a judge of human beings?

I somewhat agree that algorithms are a subjective judge of human beings. I don't think its intentional
but it just happens sometimes. Sometimes the person making the algorithms may have some unconscious
bias that makes it into the algorithm. However, I think its the data that can lead to bias more than
algorithm. Depending on how the data is gathered and processed I think thats what can lead to the 
real bias. Also, how data and statistics are interpreted may reflect bias.

Prompt 1:
The article describes qubits as holding two states at once as follows: Because each qubit represents two states at once, 
the total number of states doubles with each added qubit. One qubit is two possible numbers, two is four possible numbers,
three is eight and so forth. It starts slow but gets huge fast. The next paragraph then suggests that 100 or 280 qubits would
hold a lot of different states, which is true! You would need to devote every atom of planet Earth to equal the number of
states it could hold.
Quantitative Bit of our prompt, i.e., the QBit:
How many states could 100 qubits hold? 2^100 = 1267650600228229401496703205376
How many states could 280 qubits hold? 2^280 = 1942668892225729070919461906823518906642406839052139521251812409738904285205208498176
(Extrapolate from the pattern noted in the article... perhaps use Python, too! The ** operator can help.)
The number of states is 2 to the power of the number of qubits



Prompt 2:
Quantum entanglement is as conceptually challenging to us in 2022 as electrons were to humans in 1922. 
A different NYTimes article shares several tweet-sized descriptions and metaphors:
Choose one of these that you especially like -- or especially dislike -- and share why and/or how.

Greg Kuperberg, professor of mathematics at the University of California, Davis: 
A quantum computer is an exotic device that can run algorithms boosted with quantum randomness. 
For selected questions, a modest array of slow, large qubits will outsmart the entire Earth paved with classical computer chips.


I like this one because it explains the potential power of quantum computing. A whole earth covered in computer chips would have
unimaginable computing power, but only a few large cubits could equal this. If we somehow achieve quantum computing it will significantly
change the world and probably be one of the most important things in human history. It sounds like we have a ways to go however.

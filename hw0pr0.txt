I am answering promt 2.

I don't think artificial languages really affect human thought. 
This is mostly from personal experience.
I don't think my coding experience has affected my thoughts much outside of when programming.
I think subjects like physics, chemistry, and biology affect my thoughts because I can visualize them more in the outside world.
One thing I find intresting is that coding languages are in English only I believe, so how does this work for non-english speakers?

I think such languages are fundamentally different from English and Guugu Yimithirr.
People obviously use those languages to communicate while no one talks to each other in python.

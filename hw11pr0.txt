"The net effect of the gain in computer skill is thus, ironically, a gain in human skill. 
Humans—at least the best ones—are getting better at playing chess."

Reflect on other areas—in the past or in the future—in which you imagine computers have
made or will make humans better at something that has traditionally been a characteristically 
human strength.

I think computers have in the past, present, and in the future have helped humans with sports
and athletic performance. Traditionally sports have been just based on human strength, but computers
are starting to help athletes out. They provide statistics and analysis that can help athletes improve
as well as many other things which I don't know much about. As mentioned in the article the average chess
level has increased. I think we can see a similar thing in sports as in most sports the benchmarks have
increased. For example, the track and field record keep on getting better and better, and this likely
has been aided by computers.

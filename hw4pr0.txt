Prompt: The investigative report that uncovered the bug stated that software
"does not fail in the same sense as a mechanical system." 
Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Explain briefly.

I agree with this statement because a software system should be more predictable 
from what I know. If you give software the same input it should always give the
same output, while with a mechanical system there can be slight differences 
just because of all the factors that are there. Mechanical failures are thus
more unpredictable and sometimes unpreventable than software. If the software
is tested properly disasters like this should not happen. For example in a jet
engine there maybe some crack that is not visible to us, but software should
always be visibile.

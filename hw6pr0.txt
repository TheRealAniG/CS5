What facts, opinions, or claims did you find surprising in this article?

Tristan Harris and Nir Eyal had the same advisor at Stanford and now hold rather different positions
on the ethics of the "attention economy". Do you lean towards one of these positions more than the other?
If so, explain where you lean on this issue and briefly explain why. If you don't lean one way or the other,
please briefly explain your ambivalence.

My Answer:
Honesty I didn't find anything in the article that surprising as I have seen articles like this before. What I do find
intresting is that even though we have this information, no one really changes anything. As consumers we know we sometimes
spend too much time on social media and things like that, but I feel like most of us don't really do anything about it.

I am mostly in the middle, leaning toward pro technology. I think social media has a lot of pros and cons like anything 
else in the world. It is entertaining and informative, but is also addictive and possibly harmful for your mind. I personally 
feel like social media has benefitted me more than it harms me so thats why I lean towards supporting it.

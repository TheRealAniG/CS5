"So theory isn’t dead, yet, but it is changing – perhaps beyond recognition."    True?   False?   Other?

I think this is true. 
They used the example of how things have changed all the way from Newton to Mark Zuckerberg now.
That is a long time and the world has changed a lot so I think it is true and makes sense that theory has changed a lot in that time.
As mentioned in the article some people think theory is dead, but I think it has just changed.
AI can do a lot of things for us, but it still can't do everything and humans are needed to interpret the results sometimes.
Also, from what I know(I could be wrong) AI can make predictions from things where we have a lot of data.
However theory is still very necessary for things we don't know much about.

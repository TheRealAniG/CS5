2. The Economist summary distinguishes between "thinking" and GPT-3's "drawing on its vast database" of absorbed information...

Contrast the processes of "thinking" and "drawing on a database" for you: are they irreconcilable? loosely related? very similar? something else?
What parts of your own internal processing would you describe as "thinking" vs. "computing"?
For you, to what extent is self-knowledge a crucial prerequisite for consciousness? Is your view more stringent, less stringent, or perhaps framed differently than the article's?


I think thinking and drawing on a database are loosely related. 
I see them both as cognitive functions but drawing on databases is more just about searching through memories,
while thinking is more actively using intelligence.
I would describe computing as memory and thinking as using intelligence.
I think self-knowledge is a crucial prerequisite for consciousness. 
In order to be conscious I think one has to have its own sense and be capable of doing its own thinking, rather than just being limited to its training.
As mentioned in the article GPT completely lacks common sense which is something that a conscious being would have.

One of the changes in the article I found intresting was the idea that people won't own cars, rather
there will just be autonomous taxis. I would be willing to participate in this as I like using Uber, 
and if it has improved effeciency than that would save money. I think many people would also agree with
me in society. However one big problem I have is that I enjoy driving and if you are into cars this could 
be problematic. I would like to someday own my own nice car that I can drive around, and if there are 
autonomous taxis this might not be possible. IF autonomous cars became widespread it would basically
just be like everyone exclusively using Uber.
